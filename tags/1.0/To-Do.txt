ON THE BLOG APP

YEAR / MONTH NAVIGATION
=======================

blog sidemenus:
- latest posts DONE
- categories DONE (need numbering)
- years / months ?
- individual posts (by AJAX request)

so...
we request the blog posts.
we order them by date.
we loop through them counting years/months starting from the year/month of the latest post.
we return year objects which contain: YEAR, no_of_posts


XFM SCROBBLER
A PAGE THAT

* makes you log-in to last.fm
* plays Xfm London
* gets the track playing
* scrobbles it
* a 'love' button
* a 'disable scrobbling button' for that 'away from pooter' effect.
* add download links to amazon
* displays last.fm artist bio
* displays artist photo
* download from iTunes
