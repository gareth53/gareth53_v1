Clever bloke Rob Swan has come up with a solution which I wish I\'d got a round to doing:  http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sandbags  Pleasingly it\'s all accessible code too.

  u'<p><span style="font-family: \'Lucida Grande\'; font-size: 11px; white-space: pre-wrap;">My PSP died. I took it back. I got a new one and it had the latest firmware. Where previously there was only a web browser my PSP now had an RSS reader.  "Blimey," I thought "that\'s cool." And the more I thought about it the more cool I thought it could be.  Podcasting is powered by RSS format files, which might make the PSP the perfect tool for podcasting audio and video. *Might* is the operative word here, in practice it needs some kind of podcasting application to handle all that. Sony, i imagine, will be rolling out their own download service with their own DRM and their own bugs and infuriations (it\'s what Sony do). It was a lovely notion that I had a for a few moments though - I really enjoyed it. Maybe one day this will be a reality, but I doubt Sony are smart enough or can resist the temptation to fuck up something to graceful with a ham-fisted business plan.  On the web-browsing front, I do use my PSP. But I only visit a handful of sites that I\'m really familiar with. Otherwise it\'s a navigational nightmare. Coding a HTML site to work for such a small screen resolution AND to work for the huge resolutions routinely used my PCs.... makes my head hurt. In theory, using CSS max-width and min-width attributes it could work. In practice, support for these CSS attributes is patchy.  However, having committed myself to semantic mark-up and accessibility good practice I feel that understanding non-standard devices such as the PSP is the next horizon to aim for.</span></p>',

It\'s not an installed toolbar either, you can wander into an internet caff and start using it there and then which is mighty cool.

  u'<p>DRM of rich media has focussed on allowing users to purchase media for use on 2 devices &ndash; a home pc and a mobile device (like an iPod). Regardless of what happens with DRM (and it seems the industry is leaning towards abandoning it) it makes sense to allow users to complete these transactions with a single device.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m now podcasting using my PSP and wi-fi &ndash; no PC! One device for downloading AND listening (TIP: You need firmware version 2.7+). But browsing the interweb is still a shit experience. And I can&rsquo;t buy tunes or video direct either.</p>\r\n<p>I imagine the iPhone might be THE killer portable gadget, wi-fi support is included and you&rsquo;ll always be able to access the internet via a paid connection. It ships with the Safari browser too. That doesn&rsquo;t nessecarily guarantee that browsing the interweb will be a good userXP. The flash demo on the apple site looks impressive, but will the browser be that slick? iPhone&rsquo;s 3.5 inch screen is still a smidge too small IMO. I\'ve no idea what resolution that will be or what it will mean for web development. The browser will make copious use of a zoom function but so does Opera on the Nintendo DS and it takes a g e s to switch between modes.</p>\r\n<p>If the iPhone browser is to be useful, it\'ll have to allow users to easily browse sites that they\'ve grown comfortable with via PC browsing. That\'ll be the make or break. But there\'s still going to be little tricks and techniques that developers can employ to make their sites more compatible. Designing and building for device-independence (as accessibility guidelines implore) may take on more importance. It\'ll be interesting to see if the the touch screen can compare with a mouse &amp; keyboard. Could this be the end to the ever-prevalent "click here" link text? I hope so!</p>\r\n<p>Lurching in themes back to podcasting... Apple\'s blurb mentions podcast content, but the between-the-lines suggestion is that you still use iTunes and sync the phone with your computer. No direct single-gadget subscribing to podcasts or the ability to directly buy content using just the phone.</p>\r\n<p>(I just read this post back and it seems really disjointed.

  u"Goodbye Windows Media, Hello 'Everywhere'?",
  u'goodbye-windows-media-hello-everywhere',
  u'<p>Microsoft have had an odd history of supporting Mac products. It seems to come in cycles. Their Internet Explorer for Mac was a quality piece of kit when it first appeared, the first major browser to offer good CSS2 support and it gathered a clutch of awards. Quite rightly too. But times move on and now we\'re in an epoch where Microsoft seem to be giving up supporting the Mac-using community.</p>\r\n<p>The latest product to die a death is the Windows Media plug-in - replaced by Flip4Mac a plug-in for Quicktime which allows playback of .wma and .wmv files. Flip4Mac has been around for an age as a paid-for download but is now free and aparently endorsed by Microsoft.</p>\r\n<p>The main thrust of my interest in this subject is the motives behind the decision. Has Microsoft given up on streamed media? Of course not. But the Media Player has been edged from the market. iTunes killed .wma and Flash video streaming killed .wmv.</p>\r\n<p>I suspect Microsoft\'s motives for endorsing the Flip4Mac plug-in are a temporary stop-gap before they start pushing (the unsexily named) Windows Presentation Foundation \'Everywhere\'.</p>\r\n<p>WPF/E is Microsoft\'s answer to Flash. It has it\'s own authoring environment ("Expression") and the marketing blurb calls it a "solution for delivering rich, cross-platform, interactive experiences including animation, graphics, audio, and video for the Web and beyond". Sounds familiar, no? It supports legacy windows media formats and the project is presented as a staunchly cross-platform, cross-browser effort. It\'s pre-installed on Windows Vista and it, perhaps tellingly, has a way more sophisticated DRM than iTunes and Flash can currently muster (allegedly).</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve noticed that a whole slew of articles about Windows Media Player disappeared in a recent tidy-up for msdn.com. It feels like Microsoft are scaling back any investment &amp; support in its archaic and usurped application to ready to push a new app - isn\'t that just the Microsoft way ;)</p>\r\n<p>I xpect Microsoft to get the Vista launch and publicity out of the way before shouting about anything else. I also xpect marketeers to be let loose on WPF/E to come up with a sexy name. It\'s currently available as a preview download so it\'s still in development. By the time it finally gets a release we may have seen another version of Flash and another iteration of iTunes and Microsoft may be even further behind.</p>\r\n<p>One thing that seems unlikely though, is that Microsoft won\'t move to fill the Windows Media-shaped hole. The digital media market is about to explode and Microsoft aren\'t going to sit by and watch.</p>',

Except.... the 2 XML files are on different domains.</p>\r\n<p>The default security settings allow sloppy old IE mean to load a file from a different domain via a XMLhttpRequest object but other browsers (most notably Firefox) won\'t by default, not without the user adding the domain to their "trusted domains" list or manually changing the relevant security setting.</p>\r\n<p>I figured I could load the remote file using an ASP script and re-write the XML to present to the browser. I read hundreds of articles and forum threads on line that told me it couldn\'t be done. But I managed to get it working.

Steve warned against the idea of building pages for maximum accessibility and/or screen-readers. The technology advances and what it\'s trying to do is make simple, standards-compliant webpages more accessible. If pages are coded semantically this makes the job a whole lot easier. Hopefully such measures as access keys should be redundant. They\'ve always felt to me like a wodge of blu-tac over a much bigger problem. If the primary navigation is marked up properly, then why use access keys? For web-based applications that encourage prolonged use over a long period of time I could maybe see the point, but most of the time they feel <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">unnecessary. </span></p>\r\n<p>Anyway, all this talk puts me in mind of comments from a screen-reader user that were relayed to me. I\'m cleaning out my inbox before leaving my current job, so here\'s the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">important bits: "Did you know that the first thing many screenreader users do when they get to a website is hit ctrl-F and do a screenfind search for key words they hope might appear on that page &hellip; am talking about homepages and content pages here.... screenreader users do not use local navigation at all preferring to hit \'back\' and return to a homepage using a \'drill down\' approach to find each page. Confidence is low when it comes to searching pages. Also, better to just explore a home page and memorize it\'s layout than explore every page .... I\'d argue that better design, more clever compartmentalisation of info over a page using &lt;h*&gt; tags might kill the above habit."</span></p>',

Beckett has scored in both matches so far but won\'t stay fit for a full season, Booth can\'t be fit for a full season either, but this is probably his swansong year - hopefully he\'ll get enough opportunities from the bench to bag a couple of goals. Other than that we\'ll be reliant on goals from Cadamarteri, Schofield, Kamara &amp; Brandon. Which doesn\'t fill me with confidence.</p>',

That\'s mainly because it\'s based on technology that was developed by RCS, a company who specialise in scheduling software for the radio industry, not web-based, public-facing product.</p>\r\n<p>You could argue that given the piss-poor level of browser support it shouldn\'t be a published, promoted product. I\'d be tempted to agree with you. It leaves me feeling uneasy, but there\'s commercial pressure to launch.</p>\r\n<p>I am happy with the design and the work we managed to do given the limitations of the third-party software. It behaves beautifully in IE - even skipping tracks is nice xp - no re-buffering!</p>\r\n<p>I would have liked to illustrate the work of which I\'m proud with a screengrab to accompany this post. But given that I\'m writing this on my MacBook, that\'s not possible (without booting up Parallels Desktop which is *STRICTLY* for testing).</p>\r\n<p>Annoyingly, it doesn\'t look like wider browser support is in the pipeline either.</p>\r\n<p>So it\'s a weird feeling at this moment in time.

  u'<p>For me &ldquo;Webslices&rdquo; are the most interesting feature in the IE8 beta (which, I must confess, I haven;t installed, I\'ve merely read the documentation and reactions from those that have played with it).</p>\r\n<p>Webslices are a portion of an HTML document that users can view in a preview window in the similar way that RSS Livemarks are in viewed in Firefox, but with HTML formatting &ndash; images, styles, js ....etc...</p>\r\n<p>There\'s a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/12/the-ie8-favorites-bar.aspx" target="_blank">screengrab of a webslice in action</a> on the IE8 blog.</p>\r\n<p>And some documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=ie8whitepapers&amp;ReleaseId=567" target="_blank">Webslices White Paper</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc196992%28VS.85%29.aspx" target="_blank">Subscribing to Content with WebSlice (notes on MSDN)</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc304073%28VS.85%29.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN WebSlice Format Spec</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Crucially, publishers control what content can be websliced by using a really simple <a href="http://microformats.org/" target="_blank">microformat</a>. It\'s not an \'official\' microformat, but then microformats are hardly \'official\'.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Since the webslice is only a portion of an HTML doc that may well mess up the CSS styling. The documentation mentions:</p>\r\n<p>"The outer HTML extracted from the entry-content element is used for display in the details view. The styles associated with the HTML of the entry-content element and the original webpage are used: - imported stylesheets - style rules defined in head element - direct in-line styles"</p>\r\n<p>The lack of the cascade may cause some styling issues. But then, you may be able to use that to your advantage, meaning that the webslices appear slightly differently as a slice as they do in the pages of a site.</p>\r\n<p>From a user point of view it\'s a richer way to view content as opposed to RSS, and more flexible since there\'s muhc more context than text only RSS can provide.</p>\r\n<p>From a publisher\'s point of view it means you can syndicate more complex types of information and without having to manage a alternate context for info - RSS is currently a different file on a different URL in a different format.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, this being Microsoft, you can\'t be entirely sure that the execution will be as good as the concept. But the concept is sound. And it can\'t be long beofre we get a firefox add-on that \'does\' webslices. <a href="http://www.glazman.org/weblog/" target="_blank">Daniel Glazman</a>\'s already cracking on with one, and I\'m sure there\'ll be others.</p>',

  u'Artist Names & Song Titles - from UPPERCASE to Title Case (and the evil StUdlycAse exceptions)',
  u'artist-names-song-titles-uppercase',
  u'<p>We\'re getting a feed of data direct from the Xfm radio playout system. For some reason (that has been lost in the midsts of time) all artist names and song titles are ALL UPPERCASE. (Although it could be worse, in times gone by they were inputted FERNETICKALLY). I guess when the data was first input into the playout system it was never envisaged that anyone other than radio schedulers and DJs wuld ever see it.</p>\r\n<p>We\'ve now started displaying data from the playout system on public-facing websites - we\'re allowing users to see what tracks have been played on air over the last seven days. But the UPPERCASING is just plain ugly.</p>\r\n<p>The root and branch solution is to clean the data in the playout system. Which, it turns out, is a manual job.</p>\r\n<p>So the next solution is to transform the data at a point somewhere between the playout system and the website.</p>\r\n<p>Transforming from UPPERCASE to Title Casing is not without its problems.</p>\r\n<p>But here, in plain english is how I&rsquo;m going about it:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>lowercase everything</li>\r\n<li>Uppercase the initial character</li>\r\n<li>Uppercase characters that are preceded by a space</li>\r\n<li>Uppercase characters that are preceded by a hyphen</li>\r\n<li>Uppercase characters that are preceded by a space and an apostrophe (or the start of the string and an apostrophe)</li>\r\n<li>Uppercase characters that are preceded by an open bracket</li>\r\n<li>Uppercase characters that follow O\' (a uppercase O and an apostrophe)</li>\r\n<li>Uppercase characters that follow &ldquo;Mc&rdquo; (an uppercase M and a lowercase c)</li>\r\n<li>Uppercase characters that precede AND are followed by a fullstop (for acronyms)</li>\r\n<li>Uppercase characters that are preceded by a space AND are followed by a fullstop (for initials)</li>\r\n<li>Tackle special case MC &ndash; uppercasing &ldquo;Mc &ldquo; (uppercase M lowercase C and a space (or if uppercase M and lowercase C are the final two chars in the string))</li>\r\n<li>Tackle special case plural MCs</li>\r\n<li>Tackle special cases &ldquo;DJ&rdquo; and &ldquo;DJs&rdquo; (in the same way MC is tackled).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Looking at playlogs for a week or so of Xfm Overnights and trawling lists of artists that exist for some stations turned up some real world examples of wonkiness that might occur (they&rsquo;re include in a list at the end of this post).</p>\r\n<p>A few of the real world errors that have resulted in a manual error in inputting the data in the first place (The band name &ldquo;Lights.action!&rdquo; was missing a space and the song title &ldquo;D.I.L.E.M.M.A&rdquo; was missing it&rsquo;s final full stop).</p>\r\n<p>Generally speaking, song and album titles are a lot less problematic. The Beach Boys &ldquo;SMiLE&rdquo; is one album that comes to mind.</p>\r\n<p>In the main, there&rsquo;s two types of act name that cause problems:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Acts which have an acronym for a name. REM, NWA, Run DMC* are technically acronyms, but the name of the act seems to have transcended that and the dot notation is sometimes dropped in common usage. (* = for the record, Rapid Eye Movement, Niggaz With Attitude and er, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure but it&rsquo;s acronym M.C. Darryl McDaneils adopted)</li>\r\n<li>Acts with names where the case of letters has been deliberately manipulated: JJ72, k.d. lang (sometimes with the fullstops, sometimes without), JJ72, and (most annoyingly of all) t.A.T.u. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The first one, generally speaking, is a result of dirty, lazy data. REM use the dot notation on their official site and they&rsquo;re referred to as R.E.M. on Wikipedia. Same with Run D.M.C. (annoyingly, N.W.A don&rsquo;t officially include the final dot). With editors entering data at ALL UPPERCASE omitting the dots is an easy error to make.</p>\r\n<p>True exceptions are rare and I&rsquo;d prefer to take these errors on the chin. It&rsquo;s a relatively small number to live with. You could make a list of these exceptions, but it could become unmanageable. And the problem of dirty data is still likely to exist and be a bigger problem anyway.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve also ignored the world of pain that is roman numerals. You could do simple checks for low numbers, but testing for all possible combinations of m c x v i... It&rsquo;s gonna get complex. So I conveniently ignored it... sorry.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Specialized Capitalizations that I&rsquo;ve found</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>It&rsquo;s by no means an exhaustive list, fuelled by artist lists from Xfm and Choice FM (hip-hop and urban), but I include it here because it may be of interest.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>&iexcl;Forward, Russia!</li>\r\n<li>...And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead</li>\r\n<li>a-ha</li>\r\n<li>AC/DC</li>\r\n<li>A C Acoustics</li>\r\n<li>AFI</li>\r\n<li>AntiHero</li>\r\n<li>AM60</li>\r\n<li>aPAtT</li>\r\n<li>ARE Weapons</li>\r\n<li>bis</li>\r\n<li>bob hund</li>\r\n<li>B*Witched</li>\r\n<li>Boyz II Men</li>\r\n<li>C+C Music Factory</li>\r\n<li>Carter USM</li>\r\n<li>cLOUDDEAD</li>\r\n<li>CNN (who later renamed X-CNN)</li>\r\n<li>CSS</li>\r\n<li>The deBretts</li>\r\n<li>dEUS</li>\r\n<li>D4L</li>\r\n<li>DC Yeager</li>\r\n<li>DJ GQ</li>\r\n<li>DJ MA1</li>\r\n<li>DMX</li>\r\n<li>EMF</li>\r\n<li>FC/Kahuna</li>\r\n<li>fIREHOSE</li>\r\n<li>FR3E</li>\r\n<li>Future Pilot AKA</li>\r\n<li>iLiKETRAiNS</li>\r\n<li>INXS</li>\r\n<li>JJ72</li>\r\n<li>k.d. lang</li>\r\n<li>KLF</li>\r\n<li>KRS-One</li>\r\n<li>KT Tunstall</li>\r\n<li>LCD Soundsystem</li>\r\n<li>LFO</li>\r\n<li>LL Cool J</li>\r\n<li>Loudon Wainwright III</li>\r\n<li>MC5</li>\r\n<li>McLusky (who officially spell it "Mclusky")</li>\r\n<li>MGMT</li>\r\n<li>mu-Ziq</li>\r\n<li>N*E*R*D</li>\r\n<li>*NSYNC</li>\r\n<li>NoFX</li>\r\n<li>OK Go</li>\r\n<li>OutKast</li>\r\n<li>NLT</li>\r\n<li>N.W.A</li>\r\n<li>PD Syndicate</li>\r\n<li>PJ Harvey</li>\r\n<li>Shy FX</li>\r\n<li>Soul II Soul</li>\r\n<li>stellarstarr*</li>\r\n<li>t.A.T.u.</li>\r\n<li>Tenacious D</li>\r\n<li>TJ Cases</li>\r\n<li>The DeBretts</li>\r\n<li>TLC</li>\r\n<li>TSOL</li>\r\n<li>TQ</li>\r\n<li>TV on the Radio</li>\r\n<li>UB40</li>\r\n<li>VHS Or Beta</li>\r\n<li>will.i.am</li>\r\n<li>XTC</li>\r\n<li>ZZ Top</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>And the super-common \'typos\' that slip thru the net</strong></p>\r\n<p>(these are the correct spellings)</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>M.J.

  u'<p>TextMate\'s printing capabilities are pretty limited. This from TextMate Help:</p>\r\n<p>"To the amusement of some and the frustration of others, TextMate currently features only limited printing capabilities.</p>\r\n<p>That means you can only use the document font with no syntax highlighting and no options except the standard printing options plus header and footer fields as shown below."</p>\r\n<p>Thanks TextMate.</p>\r\n<p>So I\'m using TextWrangler for printing. It will include page numbers on the printout and retain the colour coding specified for HTML elements, attributes, values and text. Neat.</p>\r\n<p>You\'ll need to turn "Soft Wrap Text" (View &gt; Text Display &gt; Soft Wrap text) on and I\'ve found the default font to be too big - but that\'s easily changed in TextWrangler &gt; Preferences &gt; Text Printing.</p>',

They include colloqiual words and ALWAYS start with a verb (useful for getting into the user\'s headspace)</p>\r\n<p>Below the horizon.<br /> two types of boxes-<br /> white is a connection<br /> purple is a STRONG connection.</p>\r\n<p>The kindsof things that go into the top half of the diagram - diaries, field data, interview snippets, card sort data,customer feedback emails. Indi uses interviews more than anything else.</p>\r\n<p>Mental Models fed into user tasks, stories and user journeys.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why Would You Use A Mental Model?</strong></p>\r\n<p>She cites the e.g. of a piece of software that has been developed for cmopanies that manage huge fleets of trucks.</p>\r\n<p>The telephone support were using the same online interface.</p>\r\n<p>ANother e.g. The California State UNiversity site that wa a huge monolithic site for evrybody. The mental moddeling process led to the separation of the site into a colection ( a campus) of different sites for studet/arents/tutors etc.</p>\r\n<p>* Focus on customers, not internal organisaions and business terms/language/politics.</p>\r\n<p>The Mental Model is a document that has a lifespan that is potentially much longer than the old-school product spec. docs which often need to change before they are finished.</p>\r\n<p>CAN IT RESOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS MY TEAM HAS?</p>\r\n<p>We struggle to agree on a common design... eveyron has a different opinion.</p>\r\n<p>A mental model is an independent document - it\'s a document of real user\'s lives. nce you have that it\'s much easier toagree on deicsions to develop products that suports the lives of yr users.</p>\r\n<p>We have difficulty taking our employee hat off. Some times we cross our fingers that desin will be successful - Indi compares design to throwing a piece of speghetti at the wall and hoping it sticks.</p>\r\n<p>The Mental Model can make design decisions more informed decisions and give a greater confidence to the decisions that have been taken.</p>\r\n<p>A mental model can informa broader understanding of users lives - meaning that your less likely to miss crucial parts of the user XP.</p>\r\n<p>Indi presents an application that searches for properties for sale that allows users to search by cost and commute time.</p>\r\n<p>BUt a mental model could have unovered more search criteria. For e.g.</p>\r\n<p>fid commute time by public transport.<br /> find suitability of local schools.</p>\r\n<p>the mental model can help broaden your perspective as a business.</p>\r\n<p>"EMPATHY IS FOR BETAZOIDS, RIGHT?"</p>\r\n<p>We\'re software designers!</p>\r\n<p>Well....</p>\r\n<p>hear stories - feel empathy.<br /> When you can empathise with somebody, that\'s when you\'re empowered to make decisions that will benefit them.</p>\r\n<p>The example of online dating: engagecom<br /> A mental model that figured out "how to handlle an attraction"</p>\r\n<p>how do ppl make decisions about how to react?<br /> in a normal situation all the reactions are physical.</p>\r\n<p>The next step was that ppl asked a potential mate\'s friend about them.</p>\r\n<p>Tackle this engage.com alowed ppl to corall their friends t post testimonies. Other users could also ask a person\'s friends questions: "you know, on their profile, it says they smoke occasionally - is that true?"</p>\r\n<p>A lot of ppl stoad on the sidelines and watch before really engaging.</p>\r\n<p>To tackle this in an online sphere engage allowed users to post a snippet stati ng where they\'ll be at a given time.</p>\r\n<p>Then there\'s the first date - the stories here: "Feel shocked!\', "Lose spark", ::"</p>\r\n<p>HOW DO I DECIDE TO MAKE AMENTAL MODEL OR NOT?</p>\r\n<p>shows a grid of type of research (preference, evaluative, generative) vs techniques and uses.</p>\r\n<p>Diff types of research for differnt types of projects.

She highlights the \'important\', key phrses to extract and feed into a mental model.</p>\r\n<p>HOW A MENTAL MODEL CAN INNOVATE</p>\r\n<p>Innovation cannot be forced.<br /> Change needs to be understandable (something so new an revolutionary just cannot be understood and accepted easily)</p>\r\n<p>Book recommednation: "The Wisdom Of Innovation" by Scott ?</p>\r\n<p>Look at the mental model for gaps/possibilities.<br /> You might want to map your innovations over time - a gradual incremental change that users will accept.</p>\r\n<p>Documentation includes quotes direct from users</p>\r\n<p>book: Mental Models by Indi Young.</p>\r\n<p>===============================</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>HTML5 by James Hunt &amp; Lachlan Young</p>\r\n<p>why not xhtml? working to merge html and xhtml - smae syntax, dif vocab.</p>\r\n<p>design principles:<br /> when whatwg joined wth w3c, developed design principes to facilitate working together</p>\r\n<p>* compatibiity<br /> easy migration</p>\r\n<p>* utility<br /> add features that are useful</p>\r\n<p>* interoperability<br /> ensure that everything works the same way across all browsers</p>\r\n<p><strong>Spporting Existing Content</strong><br /> Browser absolutely must remain compatilbility with existing content.<br /> Cites the example of move from IE6 to IE7. Lots of sites broke - Microsoft felt that went really badly and don\'t want that to happen again.</p>\r\n<p>Degrade gracefully<br /> ensuring that new features don\'t break in older browsers.</p>\r\n<p>DON\'T REINVENT THE WHEEL<br /> If it already exists, don\'t reinvent it.<br /> We need to standardise the canvas element that apple originally developed for their dashboard widget.<br /> Canvas was then picked up by exisitng browsers, delivered in different ways.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lok at whay authoers are trying to do and improve he soutions where necessary.<br /> Good example here is the representation of dates and times in Microformats. HTML 5 has incorporated a TIME element.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>EVOLUTION, NOT REVOLUTION<br /> the developemt of html5 is aimed at being incremental improvements ather thtan throwing html4 away and stating again.</p>\r\n<p>browsers are still going to have to support html4 and xhtml1 for the forseeable future.</p>\r\n<p>SOLVE REAL PROBLEMS<br /> within the html wg, ppl come up with solutions for imaginary problems.<br /> This has been a huge issue.<br /> For e.g. ppl with ideas about metadata elements for search engines.<br /> But, actually, search engines are more interested i the data that is readable by humans rather than processing hidden, or none displayed data.</p>\r\n<p>PRIORITY OF CONSTITUENCIES<br /> priorities the needs of:<br /> users, authors, implementers, spec writers, theoretical purity.</p>\r\n<p>All solutions need to benefit (or not inconvenience) the stakeholders.<br /> You can\'t seprate the needs of all these stakeholders into lovely seprate groups</p>\r\n<p>SECURE BY DESIGN<br /> protecting end users from malicious intent - the html5 spec cannot introduce vulnerabilities - security has to be forefront of the consideration</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SEPARATION OF CONCERNS<br /> This isn\'t a strict guidline. but you can\'t hardline this in html5 - the &lt;b&gt; is in ther, as it what was in html4.01.</p>\r\n<p>DOM Consistency<br /> at the mo the way the DOM works with html4 is somewhat diff in xhtml - lots of differences in namespacing and case-insinsitivity. SOme of these have to continute - it\'s important that we don;t add to those differences though.</p>\r\n<p>AVOID NEEDLESS COMPLEXITY<br /> Authors don\'t use complex solutions.<br /> It\'s also easier for browser vendors to implement simple solutions that work, rather than a more complex solution.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>WEL-DEFINED BEHAVIOUR<br /> 90% of the web is syntactically level (google study)<br /> The push for HTML5 development is making sure that browsers do exactly the same thing with all possible input. For a lot of the invalid web browsers make a guess as to how to render the code. The push is to ensure that different browsers make the same guess.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>HANDLE ERRORS<br /> With HTML we want to make sure we\'re andling all the errors that are out there and new ones that will occur.<br /> The spec will define how errors are handled as much as is practical.<br /> HTML5 has algorithms that defines how to handle input even if the input is "crazy"</p>\r\n<p>MEDIA INDEPENDENCE<br /> HTML aims to support all diff media, devices and platfoms to a reasonable level.</p>\r\n<p>SUPPORT WORLD LANGAUGES Support for bi-directinal text<br /> Pages in any language</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ACCESSIBILITY<br /> Avoid solutions that require authors to make additional effort to make HTML accessible.</p>\r\n<p>Where possible we want to focus on built-in accessibility.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the work we\'ve done, partic in relation to table headers - to take a more specific, data-orientated approach. The impression I get is that</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>WHEN CAN WE START USING HTML5? As soon as the browser you care about implement the feaure.</p>\r\n<p>In practice, Firefox3, Opera 9.5, Safari3, IE8 all have some support for some of the HTML5 spec.</p>\r\n<p>DEMO Example page with a page header, nav, article, sidebar, footer.</p>\r\n<p>For these you\'d used &lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;s in HTML4. A div is a none semantic element.</p>\r\n<p>But it would be nice if a screen read could jump straight to the content.navigation.</p>\r\n<p>Presents a survey of commonly used class names for elements in html4</p>\r\n<p>top results include: footer menu, title, small, text, content, header, nav, copyright</p>\r\n<p>new element called:</p>\r\n<p>&lt;header&gt;<br /> a wrapper for type stuff.</p>\r\n<p>&lt;nav&gt;<br /> an easily identifiable elemnt - useful for screen readers as perviously mentioned</p>\r\n<p>&lt;article&gt;<br /> fairly obvious</p>\r\n<p>&lt;aside&gt;<br /> could be used for a pullquote. IN this example it\'s the wrapper for a list of links to archive pages of a blog.</p>\r\n<p>The example of a pullquote is a good one - in HTML 4 you\'re interrupting the natural flow of body copy. Using an aside element could allow a user to preview asieds, or go back and read them after the body copy has been read out.</p>\r\n<p>&lt;footer&gt;<br /> again, we\'re paving a cowpath here.</p>\r\n<p>&lt;section&gt;<br /> used to mark out a subsection of something.</p>\r\n<p>This allows authors to easily manage the hierarchy of &amp;ht;hx&gt; elements.<br /> the nesting within the section element can be understood by the use agent.</p>\r\n<p>&lt;time&gt;<br /> The Microformats communty has used the <abbr> element to store time. That has usability repurcussions. This is a more useful, semantically specific element. </abbr></p>\r\n<p>It\'s designed to integrate with existing Microformats.</p>\r\n<p>&lt;figure&gt;<br /> currently in html there\'s no way of marking up text that relates it to another element.</p>\r\n<p>Now we can repurpose the legend element to o that by nesting it in a  element.</p>\r\n<p>E.g.</p>\r\n<p>&lt;figure&gt;<br /> &amp;&amp;t;img src="http://www.blogger.com/mycat.jpg" /&gt;<br /> this is my cat<br /> &lt;figure&gt;</p>\r\n<p>&lt;meter&gt;<br /> for measurement systems - for ratings, capacity (like on a gmail account) example use:</p>\r\n<p>&lt;meter&gt;3/5&lt;/meter&gt;</p>\r\n<p>Could automatically render graphical representations.</p>\r\n<p>This could be used for loading bars too.</p>\r\n<p>VIDEO</p>\r\n<p>The push for native support for video in browsers.</p>\r\n<p>We\'re looking for moving away from the dependence on flash. BBC research has shown a surprising level of users without the necessary plug-ins.</p>\r\n<p>&lt;video&gt;<br /> allows an author to casually include video easily.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to build a really exciting video interface there\'s a DOM API to alloww the construction of advanced controls</p>\r\n<p>CANVAS</p>\r\n<p>Used to dynamically draw graphics and text.<br /> There will be a graphicaly-oriented DOM API.</p>\r\n<p>Three major browser vendors have very quickly implemented this.</p>\r\n<p>A new feature is support for text - there\'s a JS plotting library.</p>\r\n<p>EXAMPLE - a first person shooter written in JS</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>OFFLINE WEB APPLICATIONS</p>\r\n<p>It sounds crazy to be adding offline support in a web spec.</p>\r\n<p>Example: composing emails, reading emails offline, and then syncing when you go onlie - sending emails that are waiting to be sent.</p>\r\n<p>SO we\'ve introduced an API that allows authors to specifiy files which need to be hosted locally to allow the application to work.</p>\r\n<p>To do somethig like compose msgs in gmail you need some way of supporting data. You coul use cookies I guess but ut would be horrendous.<br /> So we\'ve added some local storage APIs.<br /> Each domain can have a persistent JS object. What you can do is add name:value properties to that JS object.</p>\r\n<p>There\'s also a whole load of events defined that tell the browser when an internet connection is lost/resurrected.</p>\r\n<p>For certain applications just using name:value pairs isn\'t adequate. There\'s also a formal SQL api. Both of these have been implemented in various places - ecent Safari builds have support.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>DEVELOPER TOOLS</p>\r\n<p>Validator.nu</p>\r\n<p>Exceeds the capabilites of trad DTD-based validators - gives more valuable &amp; specific feedback to authors.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>PARSING HTML5</p>\r\n<p>There;s an eco-system of tools building that allow the parsing of html5 - written in Ruby and Python/</p>\r\n<p>An Off-the-shelf parserreduces reliance on RegExp hacks.</p>\r\n<p>w3.org.html<br /> * whatwg.org<br /> * blog.whatwg.org<br /> (absolutely anyone can contribute here)</p>\r\n<p>* forums.whatwg.org<br /> * wiki.whatwg.org</p>\r\n<p>There\'s mailing lists and IRC.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>=====================================</p>\r\n<p><strong>Drew NcLellan - content management systems (without the killing)</strong></p>\r\n<p>edgeofymseat.com</p>\r\n<p>this presentation will cover the content management side of the CMS - not the \'building a website and presenting content effectively\' side.</p>\r\n<p>A content management system could be a physicalprocess with a person wandering around the office collecting papers and putting them in a folder. Very quckly these systems hit physical limitations.</p>\r\n<p>First....</p>\r\n<p>I\'ll mention EGGs.</p>\r\n<p>Not sure how you like your eggs. Poaching an egg is a tricky business isn\'t it?<br /> I tried it once and it was a mistake.</p>\r\n<p>We we need more predictable results - when we need something to work well and work well everytime we look to a tool to help us to do that.</p>\r\n<p>In the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Caractacus Potts prepares a machine to prepare the eggs just as he likes them.</p>\r\n<p>[Plays a cLip from said film. The incredibly over-complicated machine messes up, delivering a hrd-boiled egg instead of a fried egg, much to the machine\'s inventor\'s puzzlement.]</p>\r\n<p>As tools get increasingly more complex - the results aren\'t necessarily those you\'d expect.</p>\r\n<p>Caractacus Potts over-complicated his machine.</p>\r\n<p>He cites the invention of James Seddon, his toaster for eggs.</p>\r\n<p>He takes a very simple process and tries to make it simpler by introducing more automation. With disastrous results.</p>\r\n<p>a good CMS should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.</p>\r\n<p>What I\'m going to talk about today is bulding a CMS to a client\'s needs, without bloodshed.</p>\r\n<p>WHEN DO WE NEED A CMS?</p>\r\n<p>A case wherby a site simply has so much content, turning over at such a rate that it\'s too much to handle - this may be news stories, blog posts, whatver.</p>\r\n<p>A case whereby you want to publish the same content in a variety of formats e.g. an RSS feed.</p>\r\n<p>These repetitive tasks are exactly the sort of things that computers are good at.</p>\r\n<p>CONTROLLING you could use a CMS for increade control - rights management, scheduling, versioning...</p>\r\n<p>There are all sorts of types of CMS.</p>\r\n<p>OFFLINE MANAGEMENT</p>\r\n<p>Most basic is offline content management - Adobe Dreamweaver with Contribute for e.g.</p>\r\n<p>This allows non technical users to edit content. Can include rudimentary tools like link checkers.</p>\r\n<p>This can come into it\'s own for large static sites - especially sites that are already existing.</p>\r\n<p>What this won\'t give you is the ability to schedule content publishing, multiple language support. But it can be a good option.</p>\r\n<p>ONLINE MANAGEMENT</p>\r\n<p>Far more common - a web app that\'s running a site.<br /> A request comes in for a page and it\'s that system\'s job to decide how to respond.</p>\r\n<p>This is what we typically think about when we talk about CMSs - online formas that manage content that is stored in a database.</p>\r\n<p>These can generally be divided into 2 types of systems:</p>\r\n<p>AN OFF-THE-SHELF SOLUTION:</p>\r\n<p>for sites that fit a common pattern - a blog or a news site for e.g.g this system falls down whenever you need some kind of customisation. MOsys systems offer some way of extending functionality, but in practice this won\'t extend far enough.</p>\r\n<p>A CUSTOM CMS</p>\r\n<p>2 important things I\'ve learnt about CMSs.<br /> - everyone hates their CMS.<br /> - no CMS is forever.</p>\r\n<p>attempting to find a solution that works for today\'s needs and will work for a future set of undefined needs - it\'s almost impossible.</p>\r\n<p>COMMON FEATURES OF CMSs</p>\r\n<p>the headline things to look for:</p>\r\n<p>the ability to publish clean URLs.<br /> /shiny/happy/urls</p>\r\n<p>We\'ve often seen CMSs that don\'t deliver clean urls - usually built by software engineers who don\'t understand the web.</p>\r\n<p>Tom Coates -<br /> "Use readable, reliable and hackable URLs"</p>\r\n<p>for usability and searchability.<br /> Once you publish something to the wild - that URL should stay the same FOREVER ideally.</p>\r\n<p>URLs should be hackable - users should be intuitivley look at a URL and change it in order to get to content they think SHOULD be there.</p>\r\n<p>Good URLs are beautiful and a mark of design quality.</p>\r\n<p>DATA FEEDS<br /> RSS, atom JSON - all good to publish your lovely content in hackable formats. This is something that is not necessarily driven by a client\'s needs, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s not important.</p>\r\n<p>DATA FORMATS<br /> data should be stored in an open format - so you can gete data out for your next CMS, and, perhaps more importantly, you can get legacy data in.</p>\r\n<p>A CUSTOMISABLE &amp; ACCESSIBLE ADMIN UI.</p>\r\n<p>Any admin interface should be optimised so that a client can maximise their staffs efficiency.</p>\r\n<p>SEARCH<br /> The more content you have - the more key being able to search content.</p>\r\n<p>MULTI-SITE SUPPORT<br /> An awful lot of CMS sites are designed to generate and manage content for one site - some want to publish content over more than one site or over a network of sites.</p>\r\n<p>MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORT<br /> As long as you have good unicode support for the way data is storied, multi-language support comes much easier further down the road.</p>\r\n<p>CACHING<br /> For performance. We have a client who has a sleepy little site that comes alive once a year. You might think that performance isn\'t a key factor. However, there was a possibility that a whole slew of new traffic was going to be targeted at the site. Think of cahcing early on becasue it\'s much harder to retro-fit.</p>\r\n<p>WEB 2.0<br /> Ajax and microformats support.</p>\r\n<p>USER GENERATED CONTENT (cringe)<br /> As soon as you start accepting UGC the system needs to manage this info, commonly alongside some kind of user account.<br /> Once you\'re dealing with user accounts this opens a can of worms.<br /> You have to enable to manage &amp; delete their personal data.<br /> Comments have to be managed too.<br /> This is an area that might possibly expand a great deal - this is an area were it really pays to consider the future.</p>\r\n<p>OFF THE SHELF SYSTEMS<br /> There are hundereds. As needs vary they vary in price and scale.<br /> At the bottom end there\'s blog systesm - very specialised CMS. e.g. textpattern, wordpress, chirp.<br /> Managing posts, articles, tags, sections.<br /> they typicaly have fairly flat strucutres - but they are simple to set-up and use. BUt....</p>\r\n<p>BEWARE THE PIMPED OUT BLOG SITE<br /> It can cause real problems.</p>\r\n<p>Case Study: webstandards.org<br /> It used to be based on Moveable type with some static HTML pages stored in CVS.</p>\r\n<p>CVS proved too difficult for casual edits. Workable, but a pain.<br /> Moveable Type was painfully slow to publish - it re-published the entire collection of pages every update.<br /> Even the public userXP was bad for posting comments.</p>\r\n<p>We decided to move to WordPress.<br /> Over and above the blogging capabilities it had a new "pages" feature which would allow us to manage the largely static sites.</p>\r\n<p>It wasn\'t a fantastic experience - the pages feature was immature and needed hacking. It proved slow. Especially on the CMS side.</p>\r\n<p>Dynamic rendering is a lot more xpensive.</p>\r\n<p>Hacking WodPress was a bad idea. It compromised security. Whenever a new security update for WordPress was released we couldn\'t upgrade because of our customisation/hacking.</p>\r\n<p>The crucial lesson we learned was this - avoid getting into an unsupportable configuration at all costs.</p>\r\n<p>MEDIUM WEIGHT CMSs<br /> Mambo, Druple, ExpressionEngine, Typo</p>\r\n<p>typically these deal with user/membership stuff.<br /> plus, they offer strucutre/hierarchy management, search, workflows, versioning of content.</p>\r\n<p>beware!</p>\r\n<p>these can be a complicated way to cook an egg.<br /> more power = less simplicity.</p>\r\n<p>set-up and oncifg is more complex. mantenance and patching becomes an issue.</p>\r\n<p>ENTERPRISE LEVEL CMSs</p>\r\n<p>Red Dot</p>\r\n<p>Can be stupidly expensive!</p>\r\n<p>BUILDING YOR OWN CMS</p>\r\n<p>Which you could base on an existing framework: Django, Ruby On Rails, Cake, Symfony</p>\r\n<p>BUt we\'ve decided to develop our own CMS from the ground up.<br /> Typically we work with design agencies who design something and then come to us.</p>\r\n<p>We wanted a CMS that could handle a lot of bespoke requirements. A lot of projects are design-led - any solution we implement has to take care of that.<br /> We also decided to build for phased development and extensibility...<br /> At the core is a lot of functionality to handle the monotonous tasks: login/forotten password etc. We wanted to decrease the skil level need to deply new projects.<br /> We wanted to be competitive on small projects<br /> And we want projects to perform well....</p>\r\n<p>DO WE BUY OR BUILD?</p>\r\n<p>We looked at ExpressionEngine - but the downside was that for every project the question was "can we do this in expression engine?" NOT "how do we do this in expression engine?"</p>\r\n<p>we decided to build.</p>\r\n<p>- it\'s PHP5/2, MySQL 4.1<br /> - with flexible templating.<br /> - structure &amp; extensible data types<br /> - embeddable applications<br /> - ability to control the IA<br /> - simple admin concepts</p>\r\n<p>TOP TIPS (if you\'re building a cms)</p>\r\n<p>* know your plug-ins - authenticity, licensing &amp; support<br /> * be a licensing boffin<br /> * plan for the future, but don\'t buy it today<br /> * don\'t push your limits from day 1<br /> * be aware of any design constraints<br /> * avoid per user licensing<br /> * speak with existing customers (but remember that anyone hates their CMS)<br /> * know your exit route (store data in an open format)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>=========================================</p>\r\n<p>Details Make The Difference<br /> Dan Rubin of Sidebar Creative.</p>\r\n<p>What I\'ll be talking about:<br /> Proportional Design<br /> Brders, Lines &amp; Layer Modes<br /> Texture tricks<br /> some other stuff....</p>\r\n<p>We\'re gonna talk about how a design &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt;<br /> It\'s all abot balance - finding the right point where a deisng works.</p>\r\n<p>Proportion:</p>\r\n<p>When you\'re talking about detailed things like margins &amp; padding - these things MEAN something.</p>\r\n<p>Create patterns for margins and padding.</p>\r\n<p>Presents CNN.com re-design.</p>\r\n<p>They use padding to cerate flow - to guid the user around the site.<br /> A lot of their margins are 6, 9 and 12px</p>\r\n<p>He zooms into the top-left corner.</p>\r\n<p>They\'ve created this natural balnce with the spacing.<br /> Highlights where the consisten paddings kick in.</p>\r\n<p>It creates a visual pattern for everything to be ground into.

There\'s balance where ppl don\'t notice the design anymore - it\'s the message that\'s trying to get thru that shouts.</p>\r\n<p>He presents a bad example: the foxnews site.<br /> The entire site is left-aligned, the nav center-aligned.<br /> A lot of the text isn\'t allowed to breathe.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>TYPOGRAPHY</p>\r\n<p>Use relative text sizes to create balance.</p>\r\n<p>tracking of letter-spacing.<br /> In CSS we don\'t have a lot of control over letter-spacng yet, but I\'ve found that text looks better with a little smidge of negative letter-spacing - maybe only 1px on 14px headline copy.</p>\r\n<p>GRIDS</p>\r\n<p>I love grids! They\'re awesome for a number of different reasons - they create order.</p>\r\n<p>Presents a basic example from guardian.co.uk - has a 7 column structure (with the first two column of content spanning two columns.)</p>\r\n<p>Shows another site with columns overlaid on the design: the monocle site.</p>\r\n<p>REALITY IS RARELY SMOOTH - Using Textures.</p>\r\n<p>Everything has a texture. Obviously we can;t use real textures on the computer screen. But we can use texture in a visual way.</p>\r\n<p>Presents milemarker.com</p>\r\n<p>One of the things tat we\'re working on with tis site is to introduce ore texture to this site.<br /> We\'ve got a lot of light effects and subtle shaows - detail that most ppl won\'t notice, but they\'re there.</p>\r\n<p>A lot of ppl fall into the trap of thinking drop-shadows are bad - they\'re not, just use them with love and care.</p>\r\n<p>If we remove the sutble effects, imediately you see how flat the site looks.</p>\r\n<p>(he\'s hampered by the poor quality of the projected display here)</p>\r\n<p>the little design details really lift the page. Ever used the "add noise" filter in Photoshop? It\'s the easiest way of creating texture. It can be sued to create texture that users don\'t necessarily <em>see</em>, but they definitely <em>feel</em>.</p>\r\n<p>LINES &amp; GRADIENTS</p>\r\n<p>the livtopia sites is presented.</p>\r\n<p>the line above the nav - the tiny arrow pointing to the "current" section.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ll spend hours sometimes messing around with different blending layers and opacities.<br /> No matter what your team or corporate structure - you have to be responsible to yourself - you have to be happy with the work you do before you hand it over - so spend the time on the detail.</p>\r\n<p>LAYER STYLES IN PHOTOSHOP<br /> Styles added to a layer- handy because they can be added to a flat colour, once a client asks: "I\'m not sure about the red, can we try blue?" we can change that with one flood fill - the layer style handles the gradient for example. You can copy-and-paste layer styles too.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve had instances when I\'ve been in client meetings when they\'ve made requests that I\'ve been able to do them in the smae meeting (sometimes not a good idea when you\'re being paid by the hour ;)</p>\r\n<p>TACTILE</p>\r\n<p>The diffrence between something thats flat and boring and something that ppl can feel.</p>\r\n<p>Buttons should look like buttons.<br /> One good example is the MINT product for tracking.<br /> One thing that is done here is those little details that make buttons something that ppl want to click.</p>\r\n<p>BUttons with drop-shadows and bevels - these are not just photoshop tricks, they are real, physical things, we just need to remember that when we\'re using photoshop.</p>\r\n<p>LIGHT EFFECTS</p>\r\n<p>He\'s a tip - a really simple technique.</p>\r\n<p>He randomly picks a photo of tomatoes from a stock photo site. It doesn\'t matter what the photo is - just the lighting that\'s interesting.</p>\r\n<p>He takes a single pixel high slice of the image, copies it, pastes it and then stretches it vertically - it gives him a texture wiht a lightig effect.</p>\r\n<p>Now he fills a new layer with a solid blue.</p>\r\n<p>Takes his tomato layer and plonks that on top, and switches among the blending modes. He chooses Luminosity and gets an image he\'s pleased with.</p>\r\n<p>This is a technique he used on THE ARIES PROJECT.</p>\r\n<p>PUTTING IT TO USE</p>\r\n<p>He goes back to the foxnews site, and then shows a ock-up with the paddings fixed.<br /> It took 20 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>NOw he fixes some text-tracking.</p>\r\n<p>Any of you can do this - it\'s just basic, basic math.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve done this before in a presentation, so here\'s all my fixes for the foxnews site.....</p>\r\n<p>2 Hours work and he shows a marked improvement, just my impsing the grid, sorting the text and moving a few page elements around. Some subtle lines and shadows around the FoxNews brand. We (ahem) redesigned the logo slightly.</p>\r\n<p>KNowing when to stop is an important skil - that goes back to the "feel" of a design - when it feels right, stop.</p>\r\n<p>That\'s it.</p>\r\n<p>The pdf wil be available on superfluousbanter.org</p>\r\n<p>Q&amp;A</p>\r\n<p>Q - this feels a lot like print design - is that what you\'re advocating?</p>\r\n<p>A - no, good design is good design, good typography is good typography. I come from a background of print design - but in print design I have a different style - I use a lot of flat colours because I like the way those work in that medium. Online flat colours don\'t work in the same way.</p>',

  u"More Notes from AtMedia 2008 - Jonathon Snook's Presentation",
  u'more-notes-atmedia-2008-jonathon-snook',
  u'<p>More notes - badly spelled, typed live and posted immediately, without apology. Buckle your seats, here we go...</p>\r\n<p>"Building On The Shoulder Of Giants" by Jonathon Snook</p>\r\n<p>We\'re talking about APIs, mashups - building with other people\'s stuff - we don\'t want to kep on building the same stuff.</p>\r\n<p>About me first: I did these things:<br /> mymilemarker.com, django-plugables, an AIR wrapper for twitter, overheard.it</p>\r\n<p>The Culture - what kind of ppl developers are</p>\r\n<p>developers like to reinvent the wheel - look at the linux distro timeline - see how many branches! Another example - the # of lightbox scripts that are out there.</p>\r\n<p>Designers on the other hand, like to re-use.<br /> They use the same fonts from project from project to project - they rely on this framework of tuff- they know what works and build on top of that - developers need to borrow some of that outlook.</p>\r\n<p>Tools</p>\r\n<p>Ruby ON Rails, Django, PHP, CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Zend Framework.</p>\r\n<p>You can take nay of these frameworks and build apps wuickly and easily.</p>\r\n<p>JS Libs:<br /> jQuery, Proottype (i think it popularised the idea that we can have a JS library and that being a good thing).<br /> ExtJS - a good JS lib, complex and thorough, and they\'ve really thought thru the UI.</p>\r\n<p>CSS</p>\r\n<p>Meyer Reset - a great example of a baseline we can build on top of tat</p>\r\n<p>YUI Grids</p>\r\n<p>Blueprint - a really great idea of a baseline CSS that handles base grids, base fonts dna the basic styles for forms, labels and image layouts. 960.gs - a base for the 960px wide layout. Is supplied with photoshop layouts.</p>\r\n<p>Platforms:<br /> Adobe AIR/Flash/Flex - not oly on the web but the desktop too, there\'s this mentality that we code something that can be used everywhere. Silverlight<br /> Java/JavaFX</p>\r\n<p>The Language OF Mash-Ups.</p>\r\n<p>There\'s the communication aspect: REST, XML-RPC, SOAP. When it comes to web mashups, a lot of th web-based mashups uses REST-based APIs - it\'s the simplest way, basically an URL that returns dat in JSON or XML.</p>\r\n<p>FLASH<br /> Not necessarily the devil.<br /> When I look at building a new site I combine HTML, CSS, Flash - it depends on the requirements.<br /> Flash has built-in socket support.<br /> There\'s the Flash/JavaScript bridge - I don\'t think a lot of ppl necessarily think through the advantages of that.<br /> Binary transfer format - Flash can pass compressed data around. It allows us to do cross-domain communication - something that we can\'t do in JS - Flash has a different security model.</p>\r\n<p>Flash gives us access to new components - components that other ppl have developed - stuff like Charting, IMAP.</p>\r\n<p>Flash has given us SoundManager, sIFR, and good File Upload widgets.</p>\r\n<p>File Upload is one of those things, especially when we have things like Flickr when we\'re uploading a significant number of large files - flash gives us the ability to provide constant feedback to the user - something that the browser doesn\'t do that well by default, It\'s difficult to with JS too.</p>\r\n<p>Using Flash gives us a lot more flexibility.</p>\r\n<p>TYPES OF DATA</p>\r\n<p>We\'re beginning to see a lot of consistency in the types of apps and the types of available data..</p>\r\n<p>LOCATION<br /> Maps (Google, Yahoo, Microsoft)<br /> Great map mashups<br /> - EveryBlock the crime dtabase<br /> - Trulia (real estate prices on a map)<br /> - GPS mashups using GoogleMaps to track runs, cycle rides.<br /> - Last year\'s Tour de France provided stage maps on Google Earth<br /> - FireEagle<br /> - BrightKite (ties into the FireEagle &amp; Twittr APIs)</p>\r\n<p>TIME<br /> Everything  has a timestamp on it - every time you take a photo, post a blog, upload a vide, so we can make lifestreams - mashup of all our online life in a timeline.<br /> - FriendFeed<br /> - Jaiku (a Twiitr type app bought by Google)</p>\r\n<p>RELATIONSHIPS<br /> The whole social networking stuff - there\'s a lot of data visualisation in this area.<br /> 6 Degrees was a website was a cool site to see how manya peopl are in three degrees, how many in 6 - visualisations provided a really interesting way to look at that data.<br /> Nowadays it seems like every site I gin up for allows me to befreind ppl.<br /> - Flickr<br /> - Twittr<br /> - Jaiku<br /> - youtube<br /> - digg<br /> - linkedIn</p>\r\n<p>DOWNFALLS</p>\r\n<p>Using these APIs have pros &amp; cons<br /> good things you can do - bad things, things that bite you in the ass</p>\r\n<p>THE DISADVANTAGES</p>\r\n<p>- Dynamic APIs<br /> The Twittr API isn\'t static - it changes, it can change in ways that are really frustrating.<br /> I\'ve built a widget that builds on some functionality that was removed from the twittr API - that that\'s really frustrating</p>\r\n<p>- Service Availability<br /> Flickr has frequent downtime.<br /> There\'s ways around this - you can cache data locally, building around the contingency of the service being down.<br /> You become the middleman between the user and flickr - if you build a flickr app. and flcikr goes down, your users won\'t blame flickr, they\'ll blame you.</p>\r\n<p>THE ADVANTAGES<br /> the APIs generally are well-tested.<br /> jQuery &amp; ProtoTye have a good user-base - you have a pretty goos sense that it\'s going to reliable.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of focusing on the technical detail, this allows you to focus on the ideas.<br /> This drastically speeds up development.</p>\r\n<p>You can solve problems outside of the original solution.<br /> Christian Heilman used the YouTube API to build a more accessible version.</p>\r\n<p>Derek Featherstone used the GoogleMaps API and improved the accessibility of the app. - he used the API to re-engineer the UI.</p>\r\n<p>APIs and services give freedom to ideas.<br /> It\'s easier to capture an idea and build something on top of that idea quickly.</p>\r\n<p>You can iterate often and quickly. Somebody asked me if they could ask me if they could access their overheads by RSS. Another 3 or 4 lines of code in CakePHP and that was possible - the RSS support is built in to CakePHP.</p>\r\n<p>This speedy development allows developers to see what works and what doesn\'t.</p>\r\n<p>Flickr has new code going live every few days - they put stuff out there, if people don\'t like it, they switch it off.</p>\r\n<p>DjangoPlugables<br /> Thru Google Code he quickly made a list - built a site in 3 days. There were people out there with a similar idea but were spending too long ruminating on the idea, attempting to predict what users wanted. Longer thinking about it that it took Bryan to build DjangoPlugables.</p>\r\n<p>Slides &amp; links on this URL:</p>\r\n<p>http://snook.ca/atmedia08</p>',

  u'More Live Notes from AtMedia2008 - Steve Faulkner - :WAI: ARIA - It\'s Easy!"',
  u'atmedia2008-steve-faulkner-wai-aria',
  u'<p>Steve is employed by The Paciello Group - a software accessibility consultancy</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>WAI - Web Accessibility Initiative<br /> ARIA - Accessible Rich Internet Applications</p>\r\n<p>Even though the acronyms are confusing - WAI - ARIA is simple.</p>\r\n<p>What is it? It\'s a w3 specification, like html, cSS. Its vefy close to becoming a recommendation - we\'re at "last call" stage.</p>\r\n<p>WHAT\'S IT DO #1?<br /> It makes sense out of noise adn out of silence.</p>\r\n<p>Makes sense out of noise -<br /> theres lots of info announced by screen readers, quite often, sp in the mdern web, a lot of that stuff isn\'t clear. The correct info doesn\'t always get to the screen reader user. Content updates i particular don\'t get announced.</p>\r\n<p>What\'s it do?<br /> For a visioned user, here\'s an OK button (no problem)<br /> depending upon how it\'s coded, and quite often, what a screen reader will hear: "link graphic okay"</p>\r\n<p>(screen reader users not always blind - incuded partially sighted, people with reading difficulties)</p>\r\n<p>Following WAI-ARIA guidelines will result in the announcement:<br /> "button okay, to activate press spacebar"</p>\r\n<p>What\'s the diff?</p>\r\n<p><code> &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.do" title="OK" role="button"&gt; </code></p>\r\n<p>WAI-ARIA consists, generally speaking of a list of additional attributes to ad to existing HTML elements.</p>\r\n<p>What\'s gained?</p>\r\n<p>Correct ROLE info: "button"<br /> Results in accurate instructions, e.g. "to activate press spacebar"</p>\r\n<p>Screen Reader verbosity canbe customised (it could be set just to announce "button" and no "press spacebar to activate" every time)</p>\r\n<p>WHAT\'S IT DO? #2<br /> Buttons With 2 States</p>\r\n<p><code> </code></p>\r\n<p><code>\r\n<p>&lt;input src="btn-on.gif" alt="toggle something" aria-pressed="true" type="image" /&gt;<br /> &lt;input src="btn-ff.gif" alt="toggle something" aria-pressed="false" type="image" /&gt;</p>\r\n</code></p>\r\n<p><code> </code></p>\r\n<p>aria-pressed attributes *could* be applied to other elements, but it\'s recommednde that you use the core HTML functionality - for a start you get the built in browser functionality e.g. keyboard navigation.</p>\r\n<p>AJAX &amp; WAI-ARIA<br /> (dynamic content updates)</p>\r\n<p>2 main issues here:<br /> - users not having access to content changes<br /> - users not being aware that content has changed</p>\r\n<p>This is generally an assistive technology issues - JAWS has solved the first part of the problem since version 7 (we\'re now on version 9)</p>\r\n<p>looking at twitter as a good example of where you have dynamic content - type in the textfield and you get the number counting the number of characters available. A useful bit of functionality. However, screen readers get info in a linear way.<br /> In order to read the number they have to manually move their virtual curso back in the document, then forward again to the textfield.</p>\r\n<p>This is a good simple example - not a life or death issue - but it\'s a good example because we can extrapolate this example to other situations.</p>\r\n<p>WHAT\'S ARIA DO #3?</p>\r\n<p>Live Regions:<br /> A site author can specify areas of the DOM that are \'live\', allowing screen readers to update users when the content has changed.</p>\r\n<p><code> </code></p>\r\n<p><code>\r\n<p>&lt;span aria-live="polite"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;</p>\r\n</code></p>\r\n<p><code> </code></p>\r\n<p>The content of this span wil be read out when a user stops typing.</p>\r\n<p>live region attribute values:</p>\r\n<p>off, polite, assertive, rude</p>\r\n<p>polite - changes announced after users have completed theur current activity.</p>\r\n<p>assertive - the user agent should interrupt the user. but it may not do so immediately.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of silence, what you have now, is that the user can access dynamic content without having to know that it\'s dynamic content - it\'s not a manual process to keep checking and trying to second-guess the system.</p>\r\n<p>WAI-ARIA has taken it\'s lead from the way that OS accessibility has been built and applied thwe principles to the way the web has come to work. Web and SOftware Accessibility is merging. The standard is driving browser vendors and assistive technology vendors to dramatically improve their product. WAI-ARIA has created a buzz.</p>\r\n<p>SUPPORT?</p>\r\n<p>Support has been forthcoming.</p>\r\n<p>Mozilla Firefox has full support for WAI-ARIA<br /> JAWS has paritla support and is committed to increase support.<br /> YAHOO! - as mentioned earlier, Christian Heilman has been building WAI-ARIA support into YUI. Window Eyes Zoo Text Internet Explorer 8 has WAI-ARIA support. Dojo jQuery UI is implementing WAI-ARIA support</p>\r\n<p>we have all the major browsers, a lot of the major companies in the internet committed to WAI-ARIA.</p>\r\n<p>HTML4 + ARIA = HTML more.</p>\r\n<p>for web browsers that don\'t support ARIA, it doesn\'t break anything.</p>\r\n<p>In regards to HTML5...</p>\r\n<p>Some of the things in ARIA will have native support in HTML 5 - for e.g. the progress bar, there\'s guidelines to do this in HTML4, but increased semantics in TML5 will make this easier. There\'s still some gaps in the HTML5 spec that ARIA will fill. But who knows? It\'s an ongoing process.</p>\r\n<p>HTML5 + ARIA still equals HTML more</p>\r\n<p>ARIA RESOURCES</p>\r\n<p>http://w3.org/wai/intro/aria</p>\r\n<p>good article on Mozilla Developer site too - title HTML\'s relationship to ARIA.<br /> http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/ARIA:_Accessible_Rich_Internet_Applications/Relationship_to_HTML_FAQ</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://firevox.clcworld.net/" target="_blank">FireVox - an add-on to Firebug</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Steve now turns to some demonstrations.</p>\r\n<p>a demo of the twitter textbox and the character countdown.</p>\r\n<p>technique1:<br /> rather than announcing the number of characters left, the demo makes \'smashing glass noises\' - a single smash when there\'s 30 chars left - 2 smashes when 15 chars left, 5 smases with 5 chars left. (This demo uses flash to make the sound.)</p>\r\n<p>technique 2:<br /> Another possibility (another demo) at a given amount the browser gives an alertbox - which interrupts the user and takes the focus away from the textarea - probably a less effective (or more specifically, a more clumsy, annoying method)</p>\r\n<p>technique 3:<br /> Another demo - announcing the number of characters left when the user pauses. This is the technique described earlier an works well. Plus - it\'s just using the simple ARIA markup rather than JS/flash.</p>\r\n<p>Another demo:</p>\r\n<p>Steve boots up JAWS.</p>\r\n<p>it talks super-fast. this is slower than usual users would have it set- JAWs remember is something that you get used to and it\'s more useful set at a high speed.</p>\r\n<p>He pulls up an example in Firefox of an slider mechanism.</p>\r\n<p>Jaws, and other popualr screen reading software, has a number of different modes - a static text mode, a forms mode, a cursor mode, application mode. Generally speaking, when reading an html document the software will switch automatically between modes - i.e. it will switch to form mode when a form is reached.</p>\r\n<p>Focus on the slider - it reads "aria left, right slider, one per cent, use left and right arrows to change the value by one"</p>\r\n<p>This is a slider that is visually usable, usable via the keyboard and, using ARIA attributes, usable by screen readers.</p>\r\n<p>ANOTHER EXAMPLE - A 3 STATE CHECKBOX</p>\r\n<p>the chcekbox has three states, marked up as the following:</p>\r\n<p>role="checkbox"<br /> aria-checked="false"<br /> aria-checked="mixed"<br /> aria-checked="true"</p>\r\n<p>HTML doesn\'t really supprt 3 state checkboxes, but you might do this using JS. If you were to do this, ARIA gives a way of making this accessible.</p>\r\n<p>QUESTIONS:</p>\r\n<p>QUESTION:<br /> The question is about the sacrificing of HTML validity.<br /><br /> ANSWER:<br /> the idea is that you\'d add the attributes dynamically via unobtrusive JS. Obviously, the new HTML5 will make the need for some ARIA-specific attributes less obvious.</p>\r\n<p>QUESTION:<br /> adding new attributes via JS - doesn\'t this have a performance hit?<br /><br /> ANSWER:<br /> I\'m not really qualified to answer that - but it hasn;t been raised as a major issue, Nate? Can you answer that?</p>\r\n<p>NATE KOECHLY (YUI):<br /> Well, no, in our research it hasn\'t been a problem. There\' is, obviously, a performance hit, but the pay-off makes it worth it.</p>\r\n<p>QUESTION:<br /> The author complexity - it\'s very complex - do screen readers handle errors? <br /><br /> ANSWER:<br /> A lot of the JS libs are implementing this - that will be a big help to authors.<br /> You don\'t have to test this stuff in a screen reader - there\'s a lot of tools being developed out there. The University of Illinois have developed an accessibility toolbar for FF. There\'s also the MSSA tool from Inspect32 which allows you to interrogate elements and see the affect of attributes you might add to your HTML code.<br /> Of course, it could be a problem, if this stuff isn\'t applied correctly. The work that I do involves working a lot with companies that are developing web apps - not so much sites, but web-based applications which have complex interfaces. We as a company try and get companies to build these things as much as possible. WAI-ARIA doesn\'t replace the underlying semantics, it enhances those.<br /> The companies we\'re working with, they WANT to make their apps conformant, in the past there just hasn\'t been a way to do that, but WAI-ARIA is that way.</p>',

  u'BarCamp London 4 - My Presentation: "Nabaztag: The Sweary Rabbit"',
  u'barcamp-london-4-my-presentation-nabaztag',
  u'<p>I got my presentation out of the way early. I was underprepared, for which I apologise (but how much time does it take to prepare swear words? I am, after all, an expert with many years experience ;)</p>\r\n<p>I presented Dunn, my nabaztag rabbit. After a lot of wrangling with the wifi network we did finally manage to coax a few "sh*t", "b*****ks" and "f**ks" out of it. Maybe I should have quit there when the going was good - thank you, and good night!</p>\r\n<p>There some photos from this presentation on flickr:<br /> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57821189@N00/2545153292" target="_blank">Arty shot</a>,<br /> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rugbymadgirl/2545153206" target="_blank">Dirk &amp; Dunn</a>,<br /> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/2538154247/" target="_blank">battling with the wifi</a>,<br /> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/2538154247" target="_blank">spouting</a>.</p>\r\n<p>(Courtesy of Phillie Casablanc &amp; Rugby Mad Girl (thx!)</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve alternately loved and hated Dunn, I\'ve written a few ranty emails about Nabaztag to friends and whined to the Nabaztag customer support, so the presentation was the culmination of all that. I do like Nabaztag - I like that it\'s an ambient way of interacting with online info, I like that I get news headlines via RSS pushed to me rather than having to consciously open my laptop or mobile phone.</p>\r\n<p>The main point of the presentation was that Nabaztag has been marketed really well. It looks fan-f**king-tastic in the marketing speil and in those flash movies on nabaztag.com. And crucially, everything they claim IS possible. Just not yet. I imagine that the rabbit has sold well in excess of expectations and the technical team at Nabaztag are struggling with the volume of traffic.</p>\r\n<p>So here we go, here\'s a loose representation (or should that be re-presentation?) of what I had to say:</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is Nabaztag and what does he do?</span></p>\r\n<p>Here\'s the aforementioned flash presentation:<br /> http://www.nabaztag.com/en/m-3-nabaztag-what-does-he-do.html</p>\r\n<p>But, to surmise:<br /> - He dances.<br /> - He talks.<br /> - He listens and obeys.<br /> - He has a personality.<br /> - He has a sense of smell.v - He\'ll play with friends.<br /> - He does as he\'s told.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ll tackle these one-by-one:</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">He Dances.</span></p>\r\n<p>Well kinda.<br /> He\'s got five LED lights and two simple motors that make his ears move.</p>\r\n<p>You can, through the API, make a dance routine for the rabbit to enact.<br /> But it\'s time-consuming and under-whelming when you do.<br /> Why bother?</p>\r\n<p>What do the lights mean?<br /> The flashing purple nose appears to mean "attempting an HTTP request"<br /> A flashing blue nose means "I have messages" a click of the head will retrieve the messages.<br /> Beyond that... I forget.</p>\r\n<p>There are some network status messages, and some weather language:<br /> http://help.nabaztag.com/fiche.php?langue=3&amp;fiche=22</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">He talks.</span></p>\r\n<p>He can read emails.</p>\r\n<p>Email dunn@nabaztag.com* and he\'ll read the subject line of an email. Weirdly, he won\'t read the body of the message.</p>\r\n<p>* if you\'re emailing from a registered email address.</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">He can read RSS</span></p>\r\n<p>Yep, subscribe to an RSS feed and the rabbit will read out new headlines as and when they are published  -or you can instruct the system to only read an RSS feed at a prescribed time.</p>\r\n<p>There\'s certain peculiarities as to what Nabaztag requires. For instance, an RSS feed without a valid value for the language element will be ignored. Still valid RSS! but no good in Nabaz world.</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">He can subscribe to Podcasts.</span></p>\r\n<p>You can manually subscribe with an RSS feed URL, and there\'s a shed-load in the site with single-click subscription.<br /> As with the RSS reder, you can configure it to play new episodes as and when they become available - or to play a new episode at a prescribed time.</p>\r\n<p>He\'ll play mp3 format - both static files and live streams. There does seem to be a limit to the mp3 support though - it\'s basic support and some mp3 stream just won\'t work.</p>\r\n<p>Since Nabztag can play MP3 files you\'re also able to upload an MP3 file and then \'attach\' it to a message. You can\'t send an mp3 file as an email attachement though - that\'s a step too far.</p>\r\n<p>He will play MIDI files, but only the ones on offer from the site. You can\'t upload midi files.</p>\r\n<p>He won\'t play m4a/wma/ogg vorbis/real/quicktime or any other format other than mp3.</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">He listens and obeys.</span></p>\r\n<p>Yep - voice commands - you press the button on his head, wait for the bleep, let go of the button and voice your command, here\'s the few I\'ve found:</p>\r\n<p>"Weather"<br /> "Radio" (which will play a random radio station)<br /> "Radio OneWord" (which plays the station called "OneWord" if you have it enabled in your profile.)</p>\r\n<p>Presuambly there are others, but not many... I remain underwhelmed. Especially since OneWord is no longer broadcasting anything other than birdsong.</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">He has personality.</span></p>\r\n<p>Hmmmm.<br /> The \'personality\' is just another podcast dressed up as something different.<br /> The mp3 files that are played are randomly selected from a library of wacky clips like knock-knock jokes.</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">He can smell.</span></p>\r\n<p>Yeah. Out of his tummy button. The freak!</p>\r\n<p>The marketing would have you believe that the rabbit will sense when your partner arrives home and send you an email telling you this.</p>\r\n<p>In reality, he has an RFID detector in his stomach.</p>\r\n<p>Which doesn\'t seem to do much. The RFID tags (called "Ztamps") are still unavailable to buy.</p>\r\n<p>You can buy a series of french children\'s books which have the tags in the cover - when introduced to the rabbit he\'ll detect the RFID tag and read the book aloud.</p>\r\n<p>No other RFID services have been announced or appear to be available :(</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">He\'ll play with friends</span></p>\r\n<p>Two rabbits in the same room can synchronise.<br /> Two rabbits can sychronise over t\'internet - the marketing blurb had two young lovers using their rabbits to develop their own secret language.</p>\r\n<p>Being a cyncial, non-romantic thirty-something that leaves me underwhelmed...</p>\r\n<p>...until you get fecking hundreds of them! Here;s a youtube clip of the German opera I mentioned...</p>\r\n<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxqGkLQyDiM</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">He does as he is told...</span></p>\r\n<p>There\'s a REST-ful API. Here:<br /> http://api.nabaztag.com/</p>\r\n<p>And here\'s the basic HTML I wrote to prod and poke the API.</p>\r\n<p>http://www.gareth53.co.uk/nabaztag/</p>\r\n<p>Niels Bruin\'s  AIR app does all this stuff too:<br /> http://www.nielsbruin.nl/blog/?p=143</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now, onto the BAD BITS</span></p>\r\n<p>Just a quick moan about the website which is one of those sites that\'s over-AJAXed - too much content is loaded into the existing rendered document. It renders the browser\'s back button pretty much useless.</p>\r\n<p>The Nabaztag server can be pretty unresponsive. What\'s typical is that the rabbit will go quiet for a few hours and then suddenly have an attack of the verbal diahorrea.</p>\r\n<p>All traffic has to go via nabaztag.com, you HAVE to use their software - it\'s not ike you can install a package on your own network or your own server.</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">And now some GOOD BITS</span></p>\r\n<p>He IS cute. He can be used to swear in an amusing manner. These things don\'t get boring - although that\'s probably a reflection on my personality rather than an impartial evaluation of nabaztag itself.</p>\r\n<p>The two most useful applications of my Nabaztag is the weather update (which is offered as a Nabaztag basic functionality) and the tube updates in a morning. I have an RSS feed that I\'ve instructed Nabaztag to check every morning at 7.05am.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m picking the RSS feed here:</p>\r\n<p>http://conor.net/feeds/rss/tube.xml</p>\r\n<p>(Thanks Conor. Anybody else annoyed that TfL don\'t officially offer this info in RSS feed?)</p>\r\n<p>And then filtering everything out except the Picadilly Line status using Yahoo Tubes:</p>\r\n<p>The Yahoo Pipe is set up using a single command - a filter which "permits items that attach any of the following.... Rules: item.title Contains \'Piccadilly\'."</p>\r\n<p>What might be more helpful is if I had permit items that satisfy item.title DONESN\'T CONTAIN \'good service\' - that would just notify you of those lines with a problem. But I was being selfish.</p>\r\n<p>So there you go. I have no conclusion. I hope you liked the swearing.</p>',

  u'When can you reasonably stop supporting IE6?',
  u'when-can-you-reasonably-stop-supporting-ie6',
  u'<p>37 Signals\' Basecamp will cease to support IE6 in August:</p>\r\n<p>http://37signals.blogs.com/products/2008/07/basecamp-phasin.html</p>\r\n<p>That\'s nice. It\'s reassuring when another key site phases out that shoddy piece of out-dated software.</p>\r\n<p>But... an online application that\'s used (generally speaking) by web professionals - well, I\'d expect that kind of site to be the first.</p>\r\n<p>For a commercial website reliant on the outdated business model of generating revenue through advertising, it\'s gonna be years from now.  Until the %age of IE6 users drops below 5% for a sustained period of time support won\'t be dropped and it shouldn\'t be either.</p>\r\n<p>I once did some work for a company in the early noughties whose websites didn\'t work in IE on a Mac, in Firefox, Opera... in fact, they worked in IE5 and 6 on Windows and that was it.</p>\r\n<p>"But only a minority of our users use these browsers, it doesn\'t make business-sense". (Side-rant: Your traffic figures say they\'re the minority? Well, no shit Sherlock. It\'s because your site doesn\'t work in those browsers. They visit the homepage they see it\'s broke. They harumph, go away and NEVER come back. Isn\'t your business-sense tingling? Cos my spidey-sense is giving me a splitting headache.)</p>\r\n<p>What eventually swayed the powers that be was complaints. A combination of the increase in complaints from users and comments from people that they respected. Complaints that finally tweaked their \'business-sense\'.</p>\r\n<p>Dropping support for a userbase that still numbers 5% of your audience would be just as bad, nay worse, than failing to support newer browsers six or seven years ago. New adopters will have been savvy to the whys and wherefores of sites that failed in their shiny new browsers. They mightn\'t have liked it, but they understood it. Users that are long-standing, loyal customers and then suddenly their favourite site doesn\'t work. They\'ll be pissed off and they\'ll complain and whine and bitch. They\'re also the users that are least likely to be able, or to want, to upgrade or switch browsers. Which means they\'ll whine and bitch that much harder. You can\'t blame them, it\'s not their fault.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, thinking about it... 5% may be high. Let\'s say you have 250,000 unique users per month. That\'s 12,500 affected... around 450 a day (more in the week) even if only 10% complain that\'s till a lot of customer service resource, nerves of steel and very thick skin. OK, so I\'ll drop my threshold to 2% which, at the current rate of decline, means years and years.</p>\r\n<p>Luckily. The decline won\'t be linear. There\'s a whole host of other factors.</p>\r\n<p>You might argue that the release of IE8 might herald the death knell of version 6. I think that\'s optimistic. IE8 will probably ship this year. But even if it\'s great and even if people like it and even if people talk about it glowingly and tell all their friends about it, even if it\'s a screaming success (that\'s a lot of ifs, who thinks this is going to happen? Anybody?)... well, I still think the take-up won\'t kill IE6. The people who upgrade will be those that have already upgraded to IE7.</p>\r\n<p>My previous post talked about how workplace use is perpetuating IE6. What will it take to motivate business to upgrade? It might well take a new, screamingly successful, ridiculously easy to use and maintain, and probably free, operating system. One that saves money or makes money.</p>\r\n<p>The (buzzword alert) "cloud" might hasten a sharp decline in the last of the last-generation browsers - online applications to replace the standard packages: Outlook, Office and so on... In fact, just one killer app that the modern office and home can\'t be without But either way, we still need some kind of revolution.</p>',

  u'NME Radio vs Xfm',
  u'nme-radio-vs-xfm',
  u'<p>This was a Tweet, but rapidly got too long to be tweetable.</p>\r\n<p>Here\'s the original story:</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/sep/24/commercialradio.ipc" target="_blank">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/sep/24/commercialradio.ipc</a></p>\r\n<p>I find this ironic. And here\'s why.</p>\r\n<p>Going back five or six years, NME was undergoing complete overhaul, the writing getting simpler and less analytical, it was fast becoming to resemble something like heat magazine or Smash Hits. There was less copy (MUCH less copy) less insight, more and bigger pictures and it seemed to be covering far fewer bands.</p>\r\n<p>People were disappointed, upset maybe. Melody Maker and Select Magazine were gone (closing within two weeks of each other), Sounds was long gone. The music press was shrinking rapidly. The market was under threat so NME, fearing for its life, went in search of another audience. It went younger.</p>\r\n<p>In response, other magazines rushed to fill the void that NME was vacating. X-Ray and BANG both folded within a year. Clash magazine stumbles on, supported by government grants, and there\'s the Observer Music Monthly, but I doubt that could stand on it\'s own feet.</p>\r\n<p>I wondered at the time why magazines thought they could be the new NME, when the old NME was taking such drastic measures to survive.</p>\r\n<p>So now, when Xfm is being stripped back to basics: now two stations after being four stations just eight months ago, and shedding over half its staff in the last few months, why is NME radio thinking they can do the same but more profitably?</p>\r\n<p>There\'s the point I was trying to make. Too long for a tweet.</p>\r\n<p>I guess the Guardian journalist has given the story "an angle". But I can well imagine NME Radio thinking along the same lines, that they\'re "taking on Xfm" . Their schedule features 2 shows hosted by ex-Xfm DJs in Claire Sturgess and Iain Baker and the music policy seems similar to that of X, if more wide-ranging and less reliant on indie classics.</p>\r\n<p>This morning NME Radio played:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Howling Bells</li>\r\n<li>Primal Scream</li>\r\n<li>The Verve</li>\r\n<li>U2</li>\r\n<li>The Kooks</li>\r\n<li>TV On The Radio</li>\r\n<li>The Stone Roses</li>\r\n<li>Kaiser Chiefs</li>\r\n<li>The Knack</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>from: http://www.nme.com/radio/we-played</p>\r\n<p>This morning Xfm have played:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Zutons</li>\r\n<li>Biffy Clyro</li>\r\n<li>The Supernaturals</li>\r\n<li>The Cure</li>\r\n<li>The La\'s</li>\r\n<li>Johnny Cash</li>\r\n<li>Radiohead</li>\r\n<li>Black Grape</li>\r\n<li>Doves</li>\r\n<li>U2</li>\r\n<li>Oasis</li>\r\n<li>Kaiser Chiefs</li>\r\n<li>Manic Street Preachers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>from: http://www.xfm.co.uk/onair/playlist/recent</p>\r\n<p>Which makes a mockery of Xfm\'s claim that they play "the best new music". Maybe NME radio will force Xfm to raise their game.</p>',

  u'Film Review: The Wrestler',
  u'film-review-wrestler',
  u'<p>There\'s not many roles that Mickey Rourke can excel in any more, not with that face. Luckily, a washed-up, long-in-the-tooth wrestler bearing the scars of 20 years in the ring is one of the few, and he excels as Randy "The Ram" Robinson in Darren Aronofsky\'s "The Wrestler".</p>\r\n<p>The film follows the twilight years of Robinson\'s career as a forty-something wrestler still scratching a living in a dying sport. The days of wrestling in a packed Madison Square Garden with 1.5 million cable viewers are gone and The Ram is performing at small events in provincial high schools and community centres.</p>\r\n<p>Aronofsky\'s direction is, unusually for him, subtle and deft. There\'s dark elements, he doesn\'t shirk from showing the true pain and physical suffering that the wrestlers go through, but it\'s not as bleak or oblique as his previous works and, as a consequence, it\'s probably his most commercial film*. Comprising long takes and handheld camera work it bears the documentary-style aesthetic of a small indie movie. At its core however, The Wrestler is a straight-forward underdog story with a supporting cast of one-dimensional characters: the stripper with a heart of gold (Marisa Tomei), the bitter abandoned child (Evan Rachel Wood) and the cynical, bullying boss (Todd Barry).</p>\r\n<p>What really elevates this movie is the lead. Director Aronofsky has captured perhaps THE defining performance of Rourke\'s career. It would have been almost unthinkable a decade ago that Rourke would have any kind of acting career in the future. His turn in Sin City was a surprise and a joy, but this movie sees him take on a role in a very human movie without any kind of stylised hyper-real aesthetic. That Rourke does all his own stunts and routines in the ring adds to the film\'s painful and gritty realism.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s conventional and formulaic, but a skilled director who\'s not afraid to explore the extremities of a story, plus an incredibly strong lead performance make this a film with distinct merits. And maybe an Oscar shot for Rourke.</p>\r\n<p>* = at least until his re-imagining of Robocop makes it to cinemas</p>\r\n<p>\'The Wrester\' Links...</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.traileraddict.com/trailer/the-wrestler/trailer" target="_blank">Trailer from traileraddict.com</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1125849/" target="_blank">IMDb Entry</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/thewrestler/" target="_blank">Official site on foxsearchlight.com</a> </li>\r\n</ul>',

  u'<p>My New Year\'s Resolution for 2008 was to work harder at staying in touch with friends. I failed miserably. Should I roll this resolution over? Like a lottery jackpot? Maybe I will, but probly not.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps more realistically I\'ll be aiming to cultivate a blog habit. I managed a paltry 24 posts in 2008, up from 17 in 2007. (Although I did manage to contribute 5 posts to <a href="http://thenickandgarethpodcast.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">the blog</a> inspired buy the <a href="http://www.gareth53.co.uk/podcast" target="_blank">podcast</a>).</p>\r\n<p>This year I\'ll aim to cultivate that habit and hit at least 52 posts in the year - one a week - which seems achievable. This past year I\'ve half composed a slew of posts that I\'ve ever really finished to a level that I\'m happy with and just shelved them for \'later\'. Well, \'later\' never comes, so I\'m just gonna pot in 2009, and to hell with the quality. It\'s only my crappy personal blog after all.</p>',

  u'Film Review: Slumdog Millionaire',
  u'film-review-slumdog-millionaire',
  u'<p>What\'s really neat about Slumdog Millionaire is the framing device. The story cuts between present day, where our central hero, Jamal Malik, is competing on the \'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\' TV Show and the past of his childhood, where, as we discover exactly how Jamal knows the answers to these questions, his life story unravels. Both stories are not without twists until the two stories coincide as the movie concludes.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s a story that ranges over a myriad of topics, seemingly covering the history of India in a single fell swoop, without feeling forced or like it\'s trotting out the usual stereotypes. It\'s odd that Slumdog is being sold as a "feelgood movie" whilst covering mutilation, religious riots, mafia killings, abject poverty and scenes of torture.</p>\r\n<p>Whilst it\'s not a feelgood story, it does look gorgeous and sets a tone akin to that of the dumb rom-com that has become the staple British movie since "Four Weddings...". It\'s a chocolate-box depiction of the slums of India, with dazzlingly vibrant depictions of the violent, corrupt, filthy side of the country. But whilst it\'s gorgeous to look at, it feels uncomfortable to be cajoled into marvelling at desperate, starving Indians scratching out a livelihood on a seemingly endless landfill site. What makes this confusing clash of tragedy &amp; beauty even odder is the creative partnership that\'s produced the movie: writer Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty) teaming up with director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, 28 Days Later) - odd that you\'d reasonably expect Beaufoy to offer the feelgood and Boyle to offer the horror.</p>\r\n<p>As well as being visually stunning it\'s also self-consciously kooky, and by that I mean that every establishing shot seems to be off-set to thirty degrees - which quickly gets annoying once the novelty wears off. And despite being visually remarkable the soundtrack is likely to cause nausea and anxiety attacks.</p>\r\n<p>The lead actors excel, and the fact that the three central characters are played by three different actors doesn\'t detract at all - a fact that is entirely down to the actors involved rather than any direction or make-up. The first transition of ages happens when Jamal and his brother Salim fall from a moving train and tumble down an embankment, their faces obscured with a whirlwind of grass and earth as Boyle lets rip with the visuals. As the dust settles the characters sit up and dust down bodies that have aged five years in the blink of an eye. It\'s a nice trick of overtly acknowledging the change of personnel, leaving the audience is left in no doubt as to which character is which.</p>\r\n<p>The film loses a little pace in the final third as the estranged brothers attempt to re-unite a, X enters the final stages of his millionaire quiz but not disastrously so. I\'m writing this the day after Slumdog has scooped four Golden Globes and is being hailed as a \'masterpiece\'. It\'s certainly better than anything Boyle has done since Trainspotting.</p>\r\n<p>Slumdog links:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/" target="_blank">IMDB Entry</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.slumdogmillionairemovie.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Flash-tastic Official Site</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7819919.stm" target="_blank">"Winslet &amp; Slumdog Sweep Golden Globes" (from BBC News)</a> </li>\r\n</ul>',

  u'Artist Names, from UPPERCASE to Lovely Case (Pt.2 Dealing With Roman Numerals)',
  u'artist-names-uppercase-lovely-case-pt2-dealing-rom',
  u'<p>\r\nA while back I wrote about converting the names of recording artists and bands from ALL UPPERCASE or, indeed, all lowercase into lovely Mixed Case (or STUDly CasE, as the case may be).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href="http://gareth53.blogspot.com/2008/04/artist-names-song-titles-from-uppercase.html">Original post is here</a>...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, I got to write this code on a Hack Day we had last week. I wrote it in Python,as a learning experience mainly, and it was a great deal easier than I expected.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBack when I wrote my longhand auto-casing routine I conveniently ignored roman numeral cos it hurt my brain. Using Python\'s string methods I could easily detect whether a word was a roman numeral (within reason anyway).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/string-methods.html">the strip method</a> (and it\'s brothers rstrip and lstrip)  returns a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed. The argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed. The chars argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe count() method cam in handy too.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo, this conditional statement returns True for roman numerals upto and including 39.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><tt>\r\n((myWord.rstrip(\'ivx\') == "") and (myWord.count(\'v\') < 2) and (myWord.count(\'i\') < 4) and (myWord.count(\'x\') < 5))\r\n</tt></p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou could include the "L" and "M" characters too (L = 50, M = 100) but then you\'d have to test for words like "mix" and "mill" (and there\'s probably others). This would also improperly uppercase the band name "MILLI Vanilli. When you\'re dealing with names it\'s best to err on the side of caution.\r\n</p>',
